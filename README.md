Task:- 1
Design a user interface that displays a list of items using a model list. When an item is tapped, show the respective options below that selected item.
1. Implement a list of items using a model list.
2. Each item in the list should be tappable.
3. When an item is tapped, display a set of options related to that item between the first and second Row of list for example , I have tabbed on first Item from the first row then the menu box should be shown between the first row and second row...
4. Ensure the options are only shown for the currently selected item and not for other items.
5. The interface should update dynamically to reflect the changes when a different item is tapped.
Requirements:-

Task - 2

List<String> inputList = ["P", "P", "P", "P", "WE", "WE", "N", "N", "N", "N", "N", "S", "S", "P","P",”Z”];
// Output: [’S”, 'S', 'WE', 'WE', ’N’, 'N', ’S’, ’S’]
// Ex [’S->0’, 'S->3’, 'WE->4’, 'WE->5’, 'N->6’, ’N->10’, ’S->11’, ’S->14’]
Example :- We have “P” in the list and have the 6th time in the list so first P and Last P should be added in a new List and if there is only one value in the list then it should not be added.


Task - 3

Input
var arr = [3,2,4,6,1,7,8,5,9];
var n = 4;
The output will start with the 4th position
[1,7,8,5,9,3,2,4,6]
If n = 6
Then Output will start with the 6th position
[8,5,9,3,2,4,6,1,7]

Example :- we enter 4 then List should start  from 4 value positions and should be added before all the 4 Position values should be added in the same list but In the end.
